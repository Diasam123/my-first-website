       <p>Everyone has a different idea of what achieving success looks like or should be for them. So defining success must really be done on a personal, case-by-case level.

For example, for you, does success mean financial success? Emotional success? Physical success? Success with your family?

If you’re looking for how to be successful in life, you must take some time to first define success in your life and what it looks like for you, personally. This may be different from what your parents, colleagues, family, or friends define as success. Where your heart is will also be where your motivation and satisfaction come from.

At the end of the day, we chase success because we want to feel a certain way: happy and accomplished.

Find out what will make you feel happy and accomplished to figure out where you need to be successful in your life.

Then adopt these habits to help make achieving them easier and faster. No matter how you go about achieving success, I promise you all of these habits apply to all of your goals.

            Every action begins with a thought.

When your thoughts are positive, your will naturally feel more motivated to take action on your goals that propel you to progress and success.

The power of positive thinking can transform your life.

Even medical studies show that being optimistic and actively trying to reduce negative thoughts can have a positive effect on your health. Positive thinkers are 13% less likely than negative thinkers to have a heart attack, even among people who have a family history of heart problems.

Being positive lowers your stress level, helps protect you from discouragement, and gives you better coping skills when times get difficult.

To help strengthen your optimistic outlook, try smiling more often, adding humor to your life, practicing positive self-talk, and listing the good aspects of a bad situation. Surround yourself with positive people, images, music, books, podcasts, and environments at home and work.

Often, the only real limits on what you can do, have or be are self-imposed.

Once you make a clear, unequivocal decision to change your life by casting off all your mental limitations and throwing your whole heart into the accomplishment of some great goal, true success is so much easier and more likely to be achieved.

            Having a successful life includes having personal goals.

Often, however, we set goals and make some initial progress, but don’t achieve them.

That might be because of how we set goals.

The best and most achievable goals are SMART goals. SMART goals are achievable because they are realistic, well thought out, and include a timeline.

Create SMART goals by making them:

Specific: Create a clear, concise statement that defines exactly what you want to achieve.
Measurable: Assign a number to your goal or another way to measure it, such as “generate 250 business leads” instead of “get more leads.”
Achievable: Make sure your goal is challenging but possible to achieve so you can be successful and remain encouraged.
Relevant: Align your goal with what will make you feel happy and accomplished in life.
Time-bound: Determine when you will achieve your goal and set small milestones to achieve along the way.
